STOPPING DISTANCE CALCULATION (ft) DEPENDING ON SPEED (mph)

This app uses data from some studies done that calculated the stopping distance depending on the speed of the car.

Using this data, we create a linear regression to make predictions of stopping distance.

To use the app locally: 
	1. Download the server.R and UI.R scripts and save them on the same file.
	2. Start R studio and load the package shiny
	3. On the top right part of the script (any of the two of them), click on the Run App button.
